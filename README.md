# ðŸš€ Java Pattern & Algorithm Playground

Welcome to the **Java Pattern & Algorithm Playground**! This repository is a collection of Java programs covering **pattern printing**, **basic algorithms**, and **string manipulation**. Itâ€™s ideal for beginners who are learning Java and want to understand how loops, functions, arrays, and string operations work in real code examples.

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Compile any file using:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```
3. Explore the code and tweak parameters to see how output changes.

## ðŸ“‚ File Overview

| File Name | Description |
|:------------|:----------------|
| [`functions.java`](./functions.java) | Contains reusable methods for basic operationsâ€”perfect for learning how Java functions work. |
| [`StringBuilderFile.java`](./StringBuilderFile.java) | Demonstrates efficient string manipulations using `StringBuilder`. |
| [`Sort_Bubble.java`](./Sort_Bubble.java) | Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm with step-by-step sorting. |
| [`Sort_Slection.java`](./Sort_Slection.java) | Implements the Selection Sort algorithm. Great for comparing with bubble sort. |
| [`Sort_Insertion.java`](./Sort_Insertion.java) | Shows how Insertion Sort works and is useful for nearly sorted lists. |
| [`Number_Pyramid.java`](./Number_Pyramid.java) | Prints a number pyramid pattern. Ideal to understand nested loops. |
| [`Solid.java`](./Solid.java) | Generates a solid square pattern of asterisks. |
| [`Solid_Rhombus.java`](./Solid_Rhombus.java) | Prints a solid rhombus pattern using spaces and stars. |
| [`Butterfly_Pattern.java`](./Butterfly_Pattern.java) | Creates a butterfly pattern with symmetrical upper and lower halves. |
| [`Question1.java`](./Question1.java) | Java program to perform a specific exercise or pattern based on the first problem statement. |
| [`Question2.java`](./Question2.java) | Contains a Java implementation for a second pattern or algorithm-based problem. |
| [`Question3.java`](./Question3.java) | Demonstrates a Java solution for a third algorithmic or pattern problem. |
| [`Question4.java`](./Question4.java) | Provides code for the fourth Java question covering loops, conditionals, or algorithms. |
| [`Question5.java`](./Question5.java) | Contains a Java exercise focusing on pattern printing or simple logic implementation. |
| [`Question6.java`](./Question6.java) | Java program designed for practicing a specific pattern, algorithm, or logic problem. |
| [`Question7.java`](./Question7.java) | Another algorithmic or pattern problem implemented in Java for beginners. |
| [`Question8.java`](./Question8.java) | Java program related to either string, array, or number pattern problem. |
| [`Question9.java`](./Question9.java) | Contains Java code for a ninth question involving loops, arrays, or string manipulation. |
| [`Question10.java`](./Question10.java) | Java exercise focusing on logic, pattern printing, or a small algorithm problem. |

## ðŸ§  Tip for Learners

Start with `Solid.java` and `Number_Pyramid.java` to grasp loops, then move to sorting algorithms and functions. Add user input later for more interactivity.

If you're comfortable, take on the numbered `Question` files â€” they offer a great way to test what youâ€™ve learned and apply your skills to small challenges.
