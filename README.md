# ðŸš€ Java Pattern & Algorithm Playground

Welcome to the **Java Pattern & Algorithm Playground**! This repository is a collection of Java programs covering **pattern printing**, **basic algorithms**, and **string manipulation**. Itâ€™s ideal for beginners who are learning Java and want to understand how loops, functions, arrays, and string operations work in real code examples.

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Compile any file using:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```
3. Explore the code and tweak parameters to see how output changes.

## ðŸ“‚ File Overview

| File Name | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [`functions.java`](./functions.java) | Contains reusable methods for basic operationsâ€”perfect for learning how Java functions work. |
| [`StringBuilderFile.java`](./StringBuilderFile.java) | Demonstrates efficient string manipulations using `StringBuilder`. |
| [`Sort_Bubble.java`](./Sort_Bubble.java) | Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm with step-by-step sorting. |
| [`Sort_Slection.java`](./Sort_Slection.java) | Implements the Selection Sort algorithm. Great for comparing with bubble sort. |
| [`Sort_Insertion.java`](./Sort_Insertion.java) | Shows how Insertion Sort works and is useful for nearly sorted lists. |
| [`Number_Pyramid.java`](./Number_Pyramid.java) | Prints a number pyramid pattern. Ideal to understand nested loops. |
| [`Solid.java`](./Solid.java) | Generates a solid square pattern of asterisks. |
| [`Solid_Rhombus.java`](./Solid_Rhombus.java) | Prints a solid rhombus pattern using spaces and stars. |
| [`Butterfly_Pattern.java`](./Butterfly_Pattern.java) | Creates a butterfly pattern with symmetrical upper and lower halves. |

## ðŸ“˜ Learning Goals

- Understand loops and nested loops.
- Learn sorting algorithms step-by-step.
- Use Java classes, functions, and StringBuilder.
- Develop muscle memory for writing patterns in code.

## ðŸ§  Tip for Learners

Start with `Solid.java` and `Number_Pyramid.java` to grasp loops, then move to sorting algorithms and functions. Add user input later for more interactivity.
