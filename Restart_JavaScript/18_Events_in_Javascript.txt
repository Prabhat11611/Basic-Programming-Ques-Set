Events
In programming, event is an occurance of any action.
When we use JavaScript in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" with events.
Example: When user click the mouse button, ot press any key on the keyboard.

Let's see the events of Mouse and keyboard
Mouse:
onclick - The event occurs when the user clicks on an element.
oncontextmenu - User right-click on an element to open a context menu.
ondblclick - The user double-clicks on an element.
onmousedown - User presses a mouse button over an element.
onmouseenter - The pointer moves onto an element.
onmouseleave - Pointer moves out of an element.
onmousemove - The pointer is moving while it is over an element.
onmouseover  When the pointer is moved onto an element or one of its children.
onmouseout - User moves the mouse pointer out of an element or one of its children.
onmouseup - The user releases a mouse button while over an element.

Keyboard:
onkeydown - When the user is pressing a key down.
onkeypress - The moment the user starts pressing a key.
onkeyup - The user releases a key.



Now let's see the events of FORM
