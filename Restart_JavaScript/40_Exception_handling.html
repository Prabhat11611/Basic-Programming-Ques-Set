Exception Handling in JavaScript
Try...catch block

What is Exception?
An exception signifies the presence of an abnormal condition which requires special operable techniques.
In programming terms, an exception is the anomalous code that breaks the normal flow of the code.
Such exceptions require specialized prograing constructs for its execution.

What is Exception Handling?
Exception handling is a process or method used for handling the abnormal statements in the code and executing them.
Try, catch, throw and finally are the 4 statements used.

try{} statement: Here, the code which needs possible error testing is kept within the try block. In case any error occur, it passes to the
                catch{} block for taking actions and handle the error. Otherwise, it executes the code written within.

catch{} statement: The block handles the error of the code by executing the set of statements written within the block. This block
                    contains either the user-defines exception handler or the built-in handler. This block executes only when any error-prone
                    code needs to be handled in the try block. Otherwise, the catch block is skipped.

                                    Syntax:
                                    try{
                                        expression;
                                    } catch(error){
                                        expression;
                                    }
